## **1\. General Support Guidelines**

### **Client Communication Principles**

* **Be proactive:** If you spot issues or trends, notify the client before they reach out.

* **Use the sandwich method** when delivering bad news: Good \> Bad \> Action Plan.

### **Campaign Management Practices**

* Review campaign performance every Monday & Thursday.

* Flag major anomalies (\>30% drop in CTR, CPA spike, etc.).

* Document optimization decisions in the shared client tracker (Notion/Sheets).

### **Red Flags to Escalate Internally**

* Ad disapprovals that don’t resolve within 48h.

* Sudden billing pauses or account suspensions.

* Lead quality complaints across multiple weeks.

* Any change in conversion tracking or attribution logic.

## **2\. Client FAQ Cheat Sheet**

These are commonly asked client questions with standardized internal answers.

---

### **Q: Why are my leads dropping this week?**

**Suggested Answer:**  
 We've noticed a dip in lead volume as well — this can be due to a few reasons like seasonal fluctuations, ad fatigue, or increased competition in the auction. We're currently reviewing the performance data and will optimize creatives, bids, or audience segments accordingly. I’ll share our plan by \[insert date\].

---

### **Q: Why was my ad disapproved?**

**Suggested Answer:**  
 Meta and Google have strict automated review systems. The most common disapproval reasons are:

* Landing page violations (e.g. missing policy info)

* Ad copy that implies unrealistic outcomes

* Use of restricted keywords (e.g. “cure,” “guarantee”)

We’ve submitted a manual appeal. It typically takes 1–2 business days for a response.

---

### **Q: Why is my Cost-Per-Lead (CPL) rising?**

**Suggested Answer:**  
 There could be multiple causes: auction competition, ad fatigue, or a shift in targeting performance. We’ll audit the campaign structure, test new creatives, and refine targeting. Expect a drop in CPL over the next 7–10 days as adjustments take effect.

---

### **Q: Can I turn off campaigns on weekends?**

**Suggested Answer:**  
 We can, but we generally recommend against frequent on/off toggling since it can disrupt learning phases and performance consistency. Instead, we can test reduced bids or schedule-specific delivery windows.

---

### **Q: How often are you optimizing my campaigns?**

**Suggested Answer:**  
 We run optimization checks multiple times per week — with structured reviews every Monday/Thursday. This includes pausing underperformers, rotating new creatives, adjusting bids, and analyzing audience performance. Everything is tracked in our internal logs for full transparency.

---

### **Q: Why aren’t my conversions showing up in the dashboard?**

**Suggested Answer:**  
 This is usually related to attribution settings or pixel/tag setup. We'll run a conversion diagnostics check and verify your tracking through Google Tag Assistant and Meta Events Manager. If needed, we’ll sync with your dev team or our tracking specialist.

---

## **3\. Troubleshooting Playbooks**

### **Ad Disapproval (Meta)**

* Check Meta Policy Violation Details

* Confirm landing page compliance (terms, privacy, disclaimers)

* Submit a manual appeal

* Notify client if no response within 48h

### **Conversion Tracking Issue**

* Use Tag Assistant / Pixel Helper to debug

* Check if recent website changes removed tags

* Verify correct events are being fired

* Flag to tracking team if unclear

### **Budget Not Spending**

* Confirm campaign status (enabled, approved)

* Check delivery limits (daily caps, time windows)

* Check audience size and bid competitiveness

* Consider manual bid increases or creative refreshes
