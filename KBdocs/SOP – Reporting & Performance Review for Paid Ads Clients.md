## **SOP – Reporting & Performance Review for Paid Ads Clients**

*Last updated: May 2025*  
 *For Account Managers*

---

### **Objective**

This SOP outlines how Account Managers (AMs) at the agency should structure, prepare, and deliver weekly/monthly performance reports to paid ads clients (Google & Meta platforms). The goal is to ensure clients understand what’s happening, why it's happening, and what’s next.

Done right, reporting is not just data — it's client retention.

## **3\. Performance Insight Generation & Communicating Results** 

---

### **Part A: Generating Insights from Data**

#### **Step 1: Don’t Just Look — Compare**

Always look at the **delta**:

* This week vs last week

* This month vs previous month

* Week-over-week trends for CTR, CPL, Conversion Rate

Use conditional formatting in Sheets or Looker to highlight spikes/drops.

#### **Step 2: Spot Patterns by Funnel Stage**

Example:

* **CTR is dropping**, but **CPC is stable** → possibly ad fatigue

* **CPL is rising**, but **CTR is up** → funnel issue, not top-of-funnel issue

Your job is to segment the journey and isolate friction points.

#### **Step 3: Segment by Variables**

Compare performance across:

* Audience types (cold vs warm vs remarketing)

* Placements (feed vs reels vs stories)

* Creative types (video vs static vs carousel)

* Devices (mobile vs desktop)

Tag underperforming combinations in your summary so your strategist knows what to test next.

#### **Step 4: Cross-Check With External Factors**

Look outside the ad account:

* Did the website change?

* Did sales stop following up on leads?

* Was there a holiday that impacted volume or intent?

Bring these into your insights like a detective — clients love seeing we’re "thinking beyond the ad."

---

### **Part B: Communicating Results to Clients**

#### **Rule \#1: Translate Metrics to Business Impact**

Bad:

“CTR dropped from 1.34% to 0.87%.”

Good:

“Fewer people are clicking our ads, which suggests the messaging or visual is starting to feel repetitive. We’re prepping new creatives this week to improve initial engagement and keep cost-per-clicks low.”

Use this format:

* What changed

* Why it matters

* What we’re doing about it

#### **Rule \#2: Anchor to Their Goals**

Example for eCom:

“Our return on ad spend this month was 2.8x. That’s below our 3.2x goal, but we see strong momentum in cold traffic — indicating we’re building pipeline that should convert next month.”

Example for B2B SaaS:

“We generated 75 leads this month — 48 were MQLs by your team’s criteria. This pushes us toward our quarterly SQL target of 120 with 1 month remaining.”

#### **Rule \#3: Use Visual Language**

Bad:

“CPM dropped 9%.”

Good:

“Our ads are getting cheaper to show — imagine being able to rent 10,000 more billboards this week for the same price. That’s what happened with this CPM drop.”

#### **Rule \#4: Show Ownership**

Never blame “the algorithm” or say “it’s unclear.”  
 Say:

“We’ve isolated the drop to ad fatigue on our top video creative. Here’s how we’re solving it.”

Or:

“Tracking broke when your dev team relaunched the landing page — here’s our fix.”

#### **Rule \#5: Over-communicate the Plan**

Always end with clear forward motion:

* What are we changing?

* What are we testing?

* What should the client expect next week?

Use bold, bullets, and plain English.

### **Sample Client Summary Write-Up**

**Overall Summary:**  
 Lead volume dipped 12% week-over-week due to reduced performance from our two main creatives. CTR dropped from 1.8% → 1.2% across cold traffic, while CPCs remained stable — suggesting ad fatigue. We’re launching 3 new creatives this week focused on testimonials and product comparison angles.

**Performance Plan:**

* Launch 3 new ad creatives this week

* Shift 20% budget to new lookalike audiences

* Monitor CPL across remarketing segments

You’ll see updated results in next Monday’s report. Let us know if you’d like a quick call this week to walk through anything live.

## **5\. Internal Review SOP**

Before sending the report, follow this internal checklist:

* Performance delta calculated

* Summary written in plain English

* Action plan is tactical, not vague

* Dashboard working and linked

* Screenshot highlights (if client prefers static)

* QA’ed by strategist or senior (optional but ideal)

For monthly reports, schedule a 15-minute huddle to review as a team before sending.

---

## **6\. Best Practices & Notes**

* Never send a report with “no update” — there’s always something to say

* Keep tone confident but realistic — avoid over-promising

* Avoid data puke: don’t overwhelm with every metric

* Show patterns over time — make them feel like we have a long view

* Tie results to *business goals*, not just ad metrics
